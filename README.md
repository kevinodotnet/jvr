This software is no longer maintained. But in the event someone on the planet is still using
Dialogic hardware I thought I would upload it to GitHub instead of letting the code 
moulder away, hidden from view.

Purpose
=======

JVR's goal is to provide a Java compatability library for the Dialogic System Release Software. JVR provides Java applications with the same (or similiar) access to the Dialogic API that C/C++ applications have. As much as possible the same interfaces and behaviours are maintained. Perhaps a code example would be more informative.

Source code only. As is. I haven't combiled it in 8 years. Good luck!

If it's going to work, this is all you should need to do:

./ant
