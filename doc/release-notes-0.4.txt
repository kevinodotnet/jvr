  dx_fileopen and dx_fileclose provided on Linux platforms to enable use
    of dx.playf/dx.recf functions.

  dx_wtcallid, though I could not get it to return caller ID information
    on my D/41ESC board.  Could be my hardware though, so we'll assume
    the function is working ok.

  dx_getparm, dx_setparm and associated symbols.

  dx_open_test native executable.  After installing JVR, run this program
    to verify that the underlying Dialogic system is functional.  Always
    make sure that this program reports "OK" before sending in a JVR
    problem report.

  DxOpenTest JVR class.  Once the Dialogic runtime is confirmed, this
    JVR based application will do a dx.open test.

  Required Cygwin DLLs are included in the Windows release (in JVR/bin).

  GlobalCall support expanded considerably.

  Critial (show stopper) JNI bugs resolved.

  JVR Event model fixes.

  ISDN via GlobalCall supported and tested.

  T1 via GlobalCall supported and tested.

  T1 via "R4 ISDN" programming model supported and tested.

  GCOutbound and ImmediateCAP (Call Analysis and Progress) utility classes.

  Thanks to Shawn Deleurme for doing the Linux binary build....
