Provides the location of the main Java to Dialogic mapping
classes.  Package members are loosely divided into the
following categories:
<p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Function Classes</b>: These classes provide
	static methods that emulate Dialogic API functions.
	In most cases, the two-letter function prefixes
	(dx, ms, dt, sr, gc) have been used as the class names.
	The underscore delimiter (_) is replaced by the 
	class/member delimiter (.) and the rest of the function 
	name is used as the method name.
	<p>
	Ergo:
	<table border="1" style='border-collapse: collapse;'>
		<tr>
			<th>Dialogic Function Name</th>
			<th>Class and Static Method Name</th>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>dx_open</td>
			<td>dx.open</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>dx_dial</td>
			<td>dx.dial</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>dt_setevtmsk</td>
			<td>dt.setevtmsk</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>ms_genring</td>
			<td>ms.genring</td>
		</tr>
	</table>
	<p>
	</li>
	<li><b>Type Classes</b>: These classes provide
	equivalents for the various structures and types
	used by the Dialogic API.  In most cases they
	are given the same name (DX_CAP struct is equivalent
	to the DX_CAP object).
	<p>
	The structures have the same meanings and treatments
	as the Dialogic API types, and can usually be passed
	as method arguments in the same way as pointers to the
	types are passed to Dialogic Functions.
	<p>
	For example, when dialing on a voice resource, you would
	provide a pointer to the DX_CAP struct:
<pre>
DX_CAP cap;
cap.ca_nbrdna = 8; // 8 rings before "no answer"
// Call dx_dial and provide a pointer to the DX_CAP struct
int ret = dx_dial(chdev, "6135551212", &amp;cap, EV_SYNC);
</pre>
	But when using JVR, you provide an instance of a DX_CAP
	object.
<pre>
// Create a new instance
DX_CAP cap = new DX_CAP();
// Set a member field.
cap.ca_nbrdna = 8; // 8 rings before "no answer"
// Pass the instance object as an argument
int ret = dx.dial(chdev, "6135551212", cap, EV_SYNC);
</pre>
	</li>
	<li><b>Exception Classes</b>:  JVR supplies a collection
	of Exception classes to denote various types of errors,
	beginning with <code>JVRException</code> and extending into
	various subclasses.
	</li>
</ul>
